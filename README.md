### [Stanford Cars](https://github.com/morganmcg1/Projects/tree/master/stanford-cars)
- Fine-grained image classification of different car models (Stanford-Cars dataset)
- The goal of this series of notebooks is to achieve **90%+** accuracy using fastai
- My current best is **89.4%** accuracy 

### [Feature Testing](https://github.com/morganmcg1/Projects/tree/master/feature-testing)
- RGB Transforms: Tested whether different types of RGB transforms could improve validatoin accuracy for image classification. Randomly zeroing out 1 channel had the best improvement. Prompted after discussion on the fastai formum here: https://forums.fast.ai/t/rgb-transformations-for-data-augmentation/36876/8
- Achieved 1% increase in accuracy over baseline on Stanford-Cars dataset
